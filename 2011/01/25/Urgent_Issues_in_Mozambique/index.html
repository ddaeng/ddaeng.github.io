  <h3 id="Education"><a href="#Education" class="headerlink" title="Education:"></a>Education:</h3><p>After 1974, the war of independence, few schools were  available to teach people and more started to build but the civil war had destroyed many of these facilities. Now, there are more schools appearing to educate children, but that might not be enough.</p>
<p>In 2005, primary education was announced free, now nearly all children are attending a primary school.</p>
<p>However, even this being the case, there are very few qualified teachers, meaning there would be large classes and lack of proper, hygienic facilities. Children that reside in rural areas, particularly up to the north of Mozambique, are forced to walk long distances just to get to school.</p>
<p>Most families with parentless children or an unstable financial income often have less educated offspring as they wouldâ€™ve dropped out of school to help the family or themselves.</p>
<p>Mozambique now has high rates of HIV/AIDS, meaning that the likelihood of a parent getting infected is extremely likely. Without a parent working to support the family, children may have to drop out of school to work in order for the family to be financially stable.</p>
<h5 id="Statistics-Education"><a href="#Statistics-Education" class="headerlink" title="Statistics - Education:"></a>Statistics - Education:</h5><p>It is a tradition for girls to marry before 14 so girls put at disadvantage education-wise, so less than a third of Mozambican girls know how to read and write</p>
<p>In 2009, only 55% of adults were able to read and write.</p>
