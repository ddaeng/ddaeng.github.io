Traditionally, Mozambican artworks were sculptures and wooden carvings from the indigenous tribes. However, as Mozambique became Portuguese territory, many artists had turned to art to express the foul treatment inflicted upon them by the Portuguese. </p>
<p>During last years of colonial period, Mozambican art became a symbol of resistance. Post-independence art during the 1980s and 1990s showed political struggle, civil war, suffering, starvation and poverty. After independence, modern art came into a new phase. Two of the best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists are painter Malangtana Ngwenya and sculptor Alberto Chissano.</p>
<p>An example of Malangatana’s artworks would be: <em>Untitled</em>, 2009<br><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/7c/ec/d0/7cecd0d619c03102c17aa40b5db84c32--mozambique-art-sculptures.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>This is one of Chissano’s sculptures:<br><img src="http://www.africancontemporary.com/images/chissano-72-38x48.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Now, people of the public often paint murals on the sides of roads and walls as a form of art.</p>

In the Shetani style ( Shetani is a Swahili word meaning “devil”), the carvings are tall and gracefully curved with stylized and abstracted faces and symbols. Most are carved in heavy ebony. Another style of woodcarvings (called Ujamaa or tree of life) are totem-type structures. They show lifelike people and faces (representative of family members), huts, and everyday articles like pots and agricultural tools. The Makonde are also known for their water pots, as well as masks used in initiation ceremonies.</p>

Dance usually differd from tribe to tribe but are all ritualistic in nature. </p>
<p>The Chopi tribe, for example, act out battle scenes dressed in animal skins with weapons made of wood and sometimes ivory. The men of the Makua tribe dress in colourful outfits and masks while danicng on stilts around the village for about 2-4 hours. Women from Northern Mozambique would perform a traditional dance called <em>tufo</em>, to celebrate Islamic holidays.</p>

The <strong><em>marimba</em></strong> is a kind of xylophone native to Mozambique. The marimba is a popular instrument amongst the Chopi community as they are known for their musical skill and dancing ability. </p>
<p>Instruments like the <strong><em>lupembe</em></strong> normally set the beat of Mozambican music, which some say sounds like West Indian calypso, whilst horns made from hollow animal horns or wood would be for effects.</p>
