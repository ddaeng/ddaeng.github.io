  <h3 id="People-of-Mozambique"><a href="#People-of-Mozambique" class="headerlink" title="People of Mozambique:"></a>People of Mozambique:</h3><p>Who are the original people of Mozambique?<br>The original people of Mozambique were Bantu speaking people who migrated to present day Mozambique in the period between the first and fifth centuries AD.</p>
<h3 id="Language-in-Mozambique"><a href="#Language-in-Mozambique" class="headerlink" title="Language in Mozambique:"></a>Language in Mozambique:</h3><p>What is the official language of Mozambique?<br>The small, south-eastern African country, Mozambique’s official language is Portuguese, the language continuing to be the official language even after the four centuries of Portuguese rule alongside nine other countries of the world. The nine other countries that communicate in Portuguese are: Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde, Portugal, Guinea-Bissau, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, Macau, São Tomé and Príncipe.</p>
<h3 id="How-many-languages-are-spoken-in-Mozambique"><a href="#How-many-languages-are-spoken-in-Mozambique" class="headerlink" title="How many languages are spoken in Mozambique?"></a>How many languages are spoken in Mozambique?</h3><p>In Mozambique, there are approximately 43 different languages spoken in the country, most of them being Bantu languages. Some of the most widely spoken languages in Mozambique are Swahili, Makhuwa, Sena, Ndau and Shangaan (Tsonga). Other indigenous languages of Mozambique include Lomwe, Makonde, Chopi, Chuwabu, Ronga, Kimwani, Zulu and Tswa.</p>
<h3 id="Is-there-a-language-for-the-deaf-community-of-Mozambique"><a href="#Is-there-a-language-for-the-deaf-community-of-Mozambique" class="headerlink" title="Is there a language for the deaf community of Mozambique?"></a>Is there a language for the deaf community of Mozambique?</h3><p>In the world today, we have approximately 6,500 languages spoken. However, there are only limited numbers of sign language avaliable for those who cannot hear. In Mozambique, the deaf community are able to communicate with each other and many other people through the use of Mozambican Sign Language.</p>
<h3 id="Religions-in-Mozambique"><a href="#Religions-in-Mozambique" class="headerlink" title="Religions in Mozambique:"></a>Religions in Mozambique:</h3><p>What are the most followed religions in Mozambique?<br>The most popular religions in Mozambique are:<br>Christianity<br>Islam<br>Buddhism<br>Hinduism</p>
<p>Most Mozambicans, ever since the Portuguese introduced the religion, are Christians, mostly Roman Catholic, some alse being Protestants. 57% of the population follow Christianity, while 20% are Muslim, the rest of the 23% practising other, more minor religions.</p>
<h3 id="National-Mozambican-Clothing"><a href="#National-Mozambican-Clothing" class="headerlink" title="National Mozambican Clothing:"></a>National Mozambican Clothing:</h3><p>Ever since the Portuguese had taken over Mozambique, Mozambique was largely under Western influence, much of its original traditions and customs changed because of the government. One example of this would be the Mozambican dress. Mozambican traditional dress used to be made of capulana, a thick cotton fabric, however, in the cities now, men would wear Western-style suits for work while the women would refrain from wearing the brightly coloured fabrics of traditional wear but more Western-style desgined dresses.</p>
<p>Capulana is a type of sarong, a two metre long rectangular piece of cotton fabric that would be printed with African patterns, geometric shapes and constrasting colours. This fabric is highly prized as the number of clothing women have made of capulana determines their social status.</p>
<p>In the rural areas of the country, women would be seen more oftenly using capulana, sometimes the fabric being used to carry a child on teh back of a mother. The younger generations of Mozambique, however, almost exclusively wear Western-styled clothing, although some popular pieces of American and European fashion have not been adopted yet like denim and short skirts.</p>
<h3 id="Traditional-Mozambican-Foods"><a href="#Traditional-Mozambican-Foods" class="headerlink" title="Traditional Mozambican Foods:"></a>Traditional Mozambican Foods:</h3><h4 id="The-History-of-Mozambican-Foods"><a href="#The-History-of-Mozambican-Foods" class="headerlink" title="The History of Mozambican Foods:"></a>The History of Mozambican Foods:</h4><p>Around AD 300, Bantu-speaking Africans from the north introduced the practice of agriculture to Mozambique. The Bantu were originally farmers and ironworkers, looking for farmable land in Mozambique and through the next several hundred years, had established agricultural systems to grow maize and other grains.</p>
<p>In about the 700s, Arab merchants had set up some of the first trading posts, trading items like salt in Mozambique.</p>
<p>In 1498, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed in Mozambique during his voyage to India, quickly establishing Portugeuse ports and introducing different foods and customs to the Mozambican culture. </p>
<p>After about 500 years of ruling, the Portuguese greatly impacted Mozambican cuisine, crops such as cassava and cashew nuts all being brought in by the Portuguese. The use of seasonings like onions, garlic, paprika, red sweet peppers and wine also introduced by the Portuguese, as was sugarcane, cornmeal, millet, rice, sorghum and potatoes.</p>
<p>Some popular Portuguese dishes that are commonly eaten in present-day Mozambique are: <em>paõ</em>(bread rolls), <em>prego</em>(steak roll), <em>rissois</em>(battered shrimp), <em>espetada</em>(kebab), <em>pudim</em>(pudding) and most famously, <em>inteiro com piripiri</em>(chicken in piri-piri sauce).</p>
<h4 id="Mozambican-Cuisine"><a href="#Mozambican-Cuisine" class="headerlink" title="Mozambican Cuisine:"></a>Mozambican Cuisine:</h4><p>Mozambique has a large range of flavours and tastes that make up its exotic cuisine, mostly influenced by Portueguese foods. Being close to the sea as well with its long coastline and rich fishing presence, fish is a key part of the Mozambican diet, the country being famous for their shellfish, especially their prawns and crayfish. Mozambique is also famous for their combination of seafood dishes with spicy piri-piri sauce, an example being <em>camarões piri-piri</em>, the dish consisting of Mozambican or Angolan prawns and shrimp marinated and cooked in fiery spicy piri-piri sauce. </p>
<p>Whilst Mozambican cuisine mainly evolves around Portuguese influence, there are still some dishes that are local, staple Mozambican foods. One example could be <em>matapa</em>, a common food among locals. The dish is usually made of cassava leaves, cashews, crab, shrimp and coconut milk. Another could also be <em>matata</em>, a seafood stew that you could find being sold in the street food stalls along the beach made of clams, peanuts and pumpkin leaves.</p>
<p>Typically, breakfast is the lightest meal of the day for many Mozambicans, usually consisting of egg sandwiches, cornmeal porridge (<em>nsima</em>) and tea.</p>
<p>In towns and cities, lunch is often called <em>almoço</em>. During their lunch break, many Mozambicans purchase their lunch from street vendors, some Mozambican favourites being prego (Portuguese steak sandwich), fried chicken, stews or curries with rice like <em>caranguejo e coco</em>, a dish made of crab, curry and coconut milk.</p>
<p>Dinner, or <em>jantar</em>, is the main meal for majority of Mozambicans in the cities, dinner being a mix of Portuguese and African tastes blended together. Unlike many African cultures, dinner would be served with guests at the table. The table would have a table cloth and would be set with plates and pieces of cutlery rather than the household eating with their hands like many other African countries. For more wealthier families, there would be a three course meal, the dinner consisting of a soup or a starter for the entreé, a main and a dessert, Portuguese wine being the most common accompaniment.</p>
<p>As there is a strong Catholic influence in the country, meat would often be avoided on a Friday for many households around Mozambique. However, seeing how there is also a large number of Christians residing in Mozambique, Christmas is often a big celebration and Mozambicans would celebrate by making a cashew and potato cake called <em>bolo polana</em>.</p>

<h3 id="Indigenous-and-Cultural-Groups-in-Mozambique"><a href="#Indigenous-and-Cultural-Groups-in-Mozambique" class="headerlink" title="Indigenous and Cultural Groups in Mozambique:"></a>Indigenous and Cultural Groups in Mozambique:</h3><p>In Mozambique, approximately 98% of Mozambicans are descendants from indigenous tribes like the Makua, Tonga, Chokwe, Manyika and Sau. The five largest ethnic groups in Mozambique are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Makua</li>
<li>The Sena</li>
<li>The Shona</li>
<li>The Tsonga</li>
<li>The Swahili</li>
</ul>
<p>The Makua are the largest ethnic group in Mozambique with over 4 million people, their people occupying mostly the northern regions of the country bordering Tanzania and the Republic of the Congo. Their official language is Portuguese.</p>
<p>The Sena are second largest group with over 1.7 million people. The Sena are mostly found in Zambezi Valley, the people being thought to have migrated from the historical Judea, now Yemen.</p>
<p>Also being found in Zimbabwe, there are approximately 173,000 people in the Shona tribe and they all live in different areas according to their clans. They are mostly found in Zambezi Valley.</p>
<p>The Tsonga mainly occupy the southern parts of the country between the Limpopo and Save rivers, the group considered as the sister tribe to the Shanhaan people in South Africa and Northern Provinces.</p>
<p>Swahili people normally occupy the northern parts of the country and mostly speak Swahili. They maintain a cultural difference to other Swahilis in Kenya, Tanzania and the Zanzibar archipelago, however, still follow Islam and wear traditional Islamic attire like the hijab and thobe.</p>
<p>Other indigenous groups that make up the 98% are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Tsonga</li>
<li>The Makonde</li>
<li>The Shangaan</li>
<li>The Chokwe</li>
<li>The Manyika</li>
<li>The Sau</li>
<li>The Yao</li>
<li>The Nguni</li>
<li>The Maravi</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the remaining 2% of the country’s population are people who Portuguese Mozambicans, Indian Mozambicans, Chinese Mozambicans, Arab Mozambicans and multiracial groups.</p>
<h3 id="Customs-Folklore-and-Beliefs-in-Mozambique"><a href="#Customs-Folklore-and-Beliefs-in-Mozambique" class="headerlink" title="Customs, Folklore and Beliefs in Mozambique:"></a>Customs, Folklore and Beliefs in Mozambique:</h3><h4 id="Customs"><a href="#Customs" class="headerlink" title="Customs:"></a>Customs:</h4><p>Proper etiquette in Mozambique consists of greetings, skin contact, eye contact and much more. For greetings, they should be lengthy in order to be polite and one should inquire about the other’s health and family. </p>
<p>Contact with other people is extremely restricted, when talking to one of the same gender, the only acceptable distance between the two is an arm’s length away. When talking to one of the opposite gender, not only do they have to be an arm’s length away, but there is little to no touching at all. The only contact that is appropriate is a handshake before or after the conversation.</p>
<p>No eye contact with the other person is crucial when trying to express respect towards others, especially for elders and men. When talking to elders, it is vital to look down at the ground or you would be perceived as rude. Some women do this as well when talking to men out of respect. Normally, direct eye contact is prohibited but when you are conversing with members of the same gender or social status, that is the only time where it is allowed.</p>
<p>Another custom in Mozambique is accepting and rejcting items and offers. When recieving or giving objects, always use two hands and never one hand but when you are giving out business cards or accepting them, the right hand is the only hand you can use. It is also seen as impolite if you visit someone and not stay for tea and a snack or refuse food when it is offered.</p>
<p>In the office, a business discussion always begins with the person who initiated the meeting and closes with the most senior person in the room. Whilst gifts are normally polite, it is prohibited to exchange gifts in meetings.</p>
<p>Although there are times where teachers also make mistakes, a student in Mozambique is <strong>never</strong> allowed to question a professor’s knowledge, even when they are incorrect.</p>
<h4 id="Beliefs-and-Folklore"><a href="#Beliefs-and-Folklore" class="headerlink" title="Beliefs and Folklore:"></a>Beliefs and Folklore:</h4><p>The various ethnic groups of Mozambique contribute to a rich variety of myths and legends in the country. Traditional African religions generally place great emphasis on the importance of ancestors. The longstanding use of storytelling to preserve history has resulted in a wealth of folk traditions and stories.</p>
<p>One such legend from the Makonde people demonstrates the importance of folklore. The Makonde, who live in northern Mozambique and southern Tanzania, believe that they descended from one man who lived alone like a wild pig in the forest. The man wanted a family, so he carved a wife out of wood and eventually had children. The first two children were born near the river and both died. The third was born on the plateau and survived. This was taken as a sign that the Makonde should live on high ground. The Makonde are world-famous for their woodcarvings, of both human figures for family worship and masks for initiation ceremonies. Traditionally, they believed that their carving abilities proved they could control the world of nature and communicate with ancestors and spirits.</p>
<p>Another famous folklore story is Climbing a Rope to Heaven. Climbing a Rope to Heaven is a classic African folklore story from Mozambique in which a long braid rope connects heaven and earth to give riches to the good and misery to the evil. A young girl was sent by her mother to fetch water from the river. However, on the way, she lost her little brother. A rope uncoiled itself from a cloud, then took her to a ruined village where a woman told her an ant would tell her where to go to find her brother. </p>
<p>After arriving, a group of elders instructed her to complete two tasks: first to pull the corn up from the ground for harvesting and to then grind the corn to make porridge. The ant had told her how to complete the tasks correctly and so, the girl was led into a house where a side of infants wrapped in red lay, the other side being filled with infants wrapped in white. The ant told her to choose a white infant, and after she did, the elders gifted her bundles of cloth and jewels. However, after the girl went back to her village, her younger sister became envious and was outraged. </p>
<p>So the younger sister had went and met the woman at the village. However, she did not listen to the woman’s advice so when the ant came, she screamed with impatience and stormed off towards the elders’ village, even when the ant warned her that she would only die in the end. When she was asked to complete the tasks, the younger sister simply ravaged the garden and when she was to make the porridge, she did not know how to create it correctly and therefore, did the work carelessly. </p>
<p>When the sister was brought to the house of infants, she immediately stretched her hand to seize a red-wrapped child, but there was a tremendous explosion and she was struck dead. Heaven had gathered her bones and sent a man with them to her home. As he passed the ant, the insect cried out, “Are you not coming back dead? You would be alive if you listened to the advice!”. Once the man reached the old woman’s place in the ruined village, the carrier heard her cry out, “My daughter, haven’t you died on account of your wicked heart?” So the man went on and finally, he dropped the bones just above her mother’s hut. The elder sister only sighed and said, “She had a wicked heart. That is why Heaven was angry with her.”</p>
