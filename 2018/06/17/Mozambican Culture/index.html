<h3 id="National-Mozambican-Clothing"><a href="#National-Mozambican-Clothing" class="headerlink" title="National Mozambican Clothing:"></a>National Mozambican Clothing:</h3><h3 id="Traditional-Mozambican-Foods"><a href="#Traditional-Mozambican-Foods" class="headerlink" title="Traditional Mozambican Foods:"></a>Traditional Mozambican Foods:</h3><h4 id="The-History-of-Mozambican-Foods"><a href="#The-History-of-Mozambican-Foods" class="headerlink" title="The History of Mozambican Foods:"></a>The History of Mozambican Foods:</h4><p>Around AD 300, Bantu-speaking Africans from the north introduced the practice of agriculture to Mozambique. The Bantu were originally farmers and ironworkers, looking for farmable land in Mozambique and through the next several hundred years, had established agricultural systems to grow maize and other grains.</p>
<p>In about the 700s, Arab merchants had set up some of the first trading posts, trading items like salt in Mozambique.</p>
<p>In 1498, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed in Mozambique during his voyage to India, quickly establishing Portugeuse ports and introducing different foods and customs to the Mozambican culture. </p>
<p>After about 500 years of ruling, the Portuguese greatly impacted Mozambican cuisine, crops such as cassava and cashew nuts all being brought in by the Portuguese. The use of seasonings like onions, garlic, paprika, red sweet peppers and wine also introduced by the Portuguese, as was sugarcane, cornmeal, millet, rice, sorghum and potatoes.</p>
<p>Some popular Portuguese dishes that are commonly eaten in present-day Mozambique are: <em>paõ</em>(bread rolls), <em>prego</em>(steak roll), <em>rissois</em>(battered shrimp), <em>espetada</em>(kebab), <em>pudim</em>(pudding) and most famously, <em>inteiro com piripiri</em>(chicken in piri-piri sauce).</p>
<h4 id="Mozambican-Cuisine"><a href="#Mozambican-Cuisine" class="headerlink" title="Mozambican Cuisine:"></a>Mozambican Cuisine:</h4><p>Mozambique has a large range of flavours and tastes that make up its exotic cuisine, mostly influenced by Portueguese foods. Being close to the sea as well with its long coastline and rich fishing presence, fish is a key part of the Mozambican diet, the country being famous for their shellfish, especially their prawns and crayfish. Mozambique is also famous for their combination of seafood dishes with spicy piri-piri sauce, an example being camarões piri-piri, the dish consisting of Mozambican or Angolan prawns and shrimp marinated and cookied in fiery spicy piri-piri sauce. </p>
<p>Whilst Mozambican cuisine mainly evolves around Portuguese influence, there are still some dishes that are local, staple Mozambican foods. One example could be <em>matapa</em>, a common food among locals. The dish is usually made of cassava leaves, cashews, crab, shrimp and coconut milk. Another could also be <em>matata</em>, a seafood stew that you could find being sold in the street food stalls along the beach made of clams, peanuts and pumpkin leaves.</p>
